# Impressions
Automatically completes workflows by guessing users' actions

## How it works
Impressions will automatically detect repetitive actions and allow users to "continue" their task automatically by holding down space! This saves time that would be needed to write a script or a macro. Really beneficial for small tasks. Capable of automating large groups of actions as well.
