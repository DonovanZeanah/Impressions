The risqué gown marked a very brazen exposure for the young actress, who is known for her squeaky clean image.

PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan's Mugshots

In the latest mugshot, obtained by TMZ, Jenner is shown with her platinum blonde hair pulled back into a low bun.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, who is pregnant with her second child, showed off her growing baby bump in a clingy grey dress as she attended the Sony Pictures Classics party during the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday night (January 21) in Park City, Utah.

The 34-year-old actress was photographed out and about in Los Angeles on Wednesday, sporting a navy blue peacoat, light blue jeans and brown boots.

"I love that outfit," commented Eve.

"I do too," agreed Lily.



The two girls were silent for a few moments, both lost in their own thoughts.

"You know," Naruto said, breaking the silence, "I never really thanked you for saving me."

"Don't worry about it. Are you feeling better now?"

"Yes, thank you."

"You're welcome. I'll leave you to it."

The doctor left the room, closing the door behind her.

Yang waited for a few minutes, then opened the door and poked his head out.

“What the hell do you want?” he asked.

“I want you to kiss me,” she said.

“What?”

“We’re going to be working together.”

“I see.”



I didn't really see. I just wanted to feel.

That's all that really matters.
